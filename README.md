#Dotfiles
My dotfiles for macbook

###How to use
Create a directory in the user home directory (same place as Documents and Downloads etc), called `.Dotfiles`. Copy the contents of this in. I named it wrong and havn't got round to changing it yet, so **DO NOT CLONE** yet...  

####If you do clone
You will have to change all `bash.profile.index` references from `.Dotfiles` to `dotfiles`
